This library is designed to be easily expandable. You can add more methods to each class or create new classes for additional functionality.

Load your data into a numpy array.
Create an EMGSignal object with your data and sampling rate.

`EMGSignal`: A basic class to represent an EMG signal with its data and sampling rate.
`Visualizer`: Contains methods for plotting EMG signals in time and frequency domains.
`Preprocessor`: Includes methods for applying filters (bandpass and notch) to the EMG signal.
`Transformer`: Provides methods for Fourier transforms and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
`Convolver`: Includes methods for convolution and correlation operations.
`Sorter`: Contains methods for identifying specific points in the EMG signal, such as threshold crossings and peak detection.
`Clusterer`: Provides a method for clustering EMG data using K-means.

`PCAAnalyzer`: Performs Principal Component Analysis on multi-channel EMG signals.

`fit`: Fits the PCA model to the data.
transform: Transforms the data to its principal components.
`plot_explained_variance`: Visualizes the explained variance ratio.


`ICAAnalyzer`: Performs Independent Component Analysis on multi-channel EMG signals.

`fit`: Fits the ICA model to the data.
transform: Transforms the data to its independent components.

`WaveletTransformer`: Performs Discrete Wavelet Transform on EMG signals.

`decompose`: Decomposes the signal into wavelet coefficients.
`reconstruct`: Reconstructs the signal from wavelet coefficients.
`denoise`: Applies wavelet denoising to the signal.
plot_coefficients: Visualizes the wavelet coefficients.


`LaplacianFilter`: Applies Laplacian filtering to EMG signals.

`apply_1d`: Applies a 1D Laplacian filter to a single EMG signal.
`apply_2d`: Applies a 2D Laplacian filter to multi-channel EMG signals.



```python
# Assuming you have loaded your EMG data into emg_signals
your_emg_data = np.load('your_emg_data.npy')
sampling_rate = 1000  # Replace with your actual sampling rate

# Create EMGSignal object
your_emg_signal = EMGSignal(your_emg_data, sampling_rate)

# Process your signal
filtered_signal = Preprocessor.bandpass_filter(your_emg_signal, lowcut=10, highcut=450)
Visualizer.plot_time_domain(filtered_signal)

# Perform PCA
pca_analyzer = PCAAnalyzer(n_components=5)
pca_analyzer.fit(emg_signals)
pca_components = pca_analyzer.transform(emg_signals)
pca_analyzer.plot_explained_variance()

# Perform ICA
ica_analyzer = ICAAnalyzer(n_components=5)
ica_analyzer.fit(emg_signals)
ica_components = ica_analyzer.transform(emg_signals)

# Apply Wavelet Transform
wt = WaveletTransformer(wavelet='db4', level=5)
denoised_signals = [wt.denoise(signal) for signal in emg_signals]

# Apply Laplacian Filter
laplacian_filtered = LaplacianFilter.apply_2d(emg_signals)

# Visualize or further process the results as needed
